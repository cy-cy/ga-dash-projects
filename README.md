<h1>General Assembly's Dash Projects</h1>

<a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/" target="_new">General Assembly Dash</a> is an introduction to HTML, CSS and Javascript through a series of step by step tutorials. Below are my projects for each tutorial.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://cy-cy.github.io/ga-dash-projects/dash-project-one.html">Project 1: Build a personal website</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cy-cy.github.io/ga-dash-projects/dash-project-two.html">Project 2: Build a responsive blog theme</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cy-cy.github.io/ga-dash-projects/dash-project-three.html">Project 3: Build a small business website</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cy-cy.github.io/ga-dash-projects/dash-project-four.html">Project 4: Build a CSS Robot</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cy-cy.github.io/ga-dash-projects/dash-project-five.html">Project 5: Build a Madlibs Game</a></li>
</ul>

The series was easy to go through. I used Firefox 53 and Windows OS, and didn't have too many issues. The support for the tutorials is a bit awkward as it's a link to a Facebook group where students post code snippets hoping to get help about why their code isn't working.

I'd recommend it to anyone curious about dipping their toe into front end web development. The tone of the instructions are light and the projects are made to seem like you are building for an actual client. Breaking up the code and instructions with some natural human dialog was really nice.
