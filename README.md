<h1>General Assembly's Dash Projects</h1>

<a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/" target="_new">General Assembly Dash</a> is an introduction to HTML, CSS and Javascript through a series of step by step tutorials. Below are my projects for each tutorial.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://cy-cy.github.io/ga-dash-projects/dash-project-one.html">Project 1: Build a personal website</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cy-cy.github.io/ga-dash-projects/dash-project-two.html">Project 2: Build a responsive blog theme</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cy-cy.github.io/ga-dash-projects/dash-project-three.html">Project 3: Build a small business website</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cy-cy.github.io/ga-dash-projects/dash-project-four.html">Project 4: Build a CSS Robot</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cy-cy.github.io/ga-dash-projects/dash-project-five.html">Project 5: Build a Madlibs Game</a></li>
</ul>

The series was easy to go through. The support for the tutorials is a bit awkward as it's a link to a Facebook group where students post code snippets hoping to get help about why their code isn't working. There was an issue where the robot's eyes in Project 4 were blinking from 2 eyes to 1 eye that Dash's system doesn't catch. I think the animated gif asset prepared for the project was also moved out of the location mentioned in the tutorial as well.

I'd recommend it to anyone curious about dipping their toe into front end web development. The tone of the instructions are light and the projects are made to seem like you are building for an actual client. There were some slides with some natural human dialog from your "clients" and it was a welcome break from the code snippets and instructions.
