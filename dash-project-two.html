    <h2>Today's Cup: Candy Cane Lane</h2>
    <h3>January 15, 2017</h3>
    <p>Today's Cup is Celestial Seasonings' <a class="post" href="http://www.celestialseasonings.com/products/green/candy-cane-lane">Candy Cane Lane</a>.</p>
	<img class="post" src="img/CS_CCL_20CT_FrontView_2016_LoRes.jpg" alt="Candy Cane Lane" width="550">
    <p>My love for this tea has surpassed Nutcracker Sweet, another Ceslestial Seasonings tea. It's a green tea that is a gentle blend with Vanilla. It's a subtle sweetness that really charms my guests. I love it so much that I practically shoved a box into their arms as parting gifts last year, leading to this year's shortage. (Now I've got boxes and boxes stacked up the side of my pantry.)<p>
    <p><b>Have you ever tried green tea, just to try it once, and it just tasted bad?</b> Once I recommended this tea to a friend. She told me that she's had a bad experience with green tea and doesn't like it. I asked her what it tasted like. "Really bitter." I asked her  how long she left the bag in the water and she didn't remember.</p> 
    <p><b>Candy Cane Lane to the rescue!</b> This tea is really easy to recommend to people that have tried green teas and had a bad experience due to oversteeping, when they've left the tea in the cup too long and the tea took on a grassy or bitter taste. It remains true to its slightly sweet and clean taste, even if you forget to take out the tea bag.</p> 
    <p><b>Barely about the tea: </b>And don't get me started on its <i>heavenly smell</i>. I mean it, don't. And this artwork, come on. Polar bears painting the stripes on candy canes? It's timeless and whimsical without making you choke on the holiday spirit.</p> 
    <p><b>The hunt begins:</b> Come November, I have to hunt down grocery store end caps or standlone displays at the end of the aisles to get this tea in my hometown. If I'm unable to find it after a few tries, I head straight to the CelestialSeasonings.com website. If you sign up for their email list, they'll send you a 10% off coupon. I've seen a 15% off coupon in my inbox in previous years, but it's limited to their holiday teas. If you can find it in your grocerty store, grab a bunch to avoid eating those shipping fees!</p>        
       <p class="quote"><b>The seller describes it:</b> Our spirited holiday blend starts with naturally decaffeinated green tea and adds seasonal flavors like cool peppermint, creamy vanilla and a dash of cinnamon.</p>

    <h2>Today's Cup: Chocolate Mint Lavender</h2>
    <h3>January 10, 2017</h3>
    <p>Today's Cup is Cedarbrook Herb Farm's <a class="post" href="https://www.cedarbrookherbfarm.com/storeitem.cfm?ID=182&Cat=1&CFID=131829584&CFTOKEN=17866202">Chocolate Mint Lavender</a>.<p>
    <img class="post" src="img/cedarbrook-chocolate-mint-lavender-tea.jpg" alt="Chocolate Mint Lavender" width="267">
    <p><b>A blend of chocolate, mint and real culinary lavender</b> Because this is a black tea that gives off a lovely chocolate and lavender smell, and gives a subtle cocoa kiss to the minty finish, I pour this when having a simple flavored dessert like a white sponge cake. </p> 
	<p><b>Hot or Iced?</b> This is one of my teas that I like to brew hot and also brew for iced tea. I sometimes sweeten the iced version, but I think that it appeals to more people when left unsweetened. It's so good in the summer and has a beautiful look in the iced glass. Just looking at it is refreshing.</p> 
	<p><b>Costume change! </b> The loose leaf teas are packaged in zippered plastic bags that have paper labels stapled to the top. Although simple and easy to open, I immediately rescue the blend from the plastic and put them in tightly-sealing tins that I've saved from previous tea blends. Keeping this tea properly stored will keep that wonderful smell of all the ingredients alive and the tea will pack its full punch of aromatherapy, too.</p> 
	<p><b>"Tease me no longer! Where can I find it?"</b> You aren't going to find this tea cruising around your grocery store, I'm afraid. During a visit to the Sequim Lavender Festival and Faire in Washington, I ended up taking tea at Cedarbrook Lavender and Herb Farm. Back then, they were open to the public and had a cafe, where this tea was served iced and beautifully garnished with fresh lavender. At the time of my writing this, the farm is not open to the public, but you can find this tea in their web site's online shop. I'm down to my last 2 six ounce bags, and will be turning to this site when it's all brewed and done.</p> 
    <p class="quote"><b>The seller describes it:</b> Chocolate mint black tea, raspberries, mint leaves and culinary lavender flowers. The aroma and taste are very festive for anytime of the year. It tastes great as an iced tea!</p></p>

    <h2>Today's Tip: Treat your tea like Goldilocks</h2>
    <h3>January 5, 2017</h3>
    <p>Today's Tip is to <b>steep your tea at the right water temperature and brewing time</b>. </p> 
    <img class="post" src="img/tea-1132529_640.jpg" width="550" alt="Different Teas need Different Steepings">
	<p>Have you ever had tea that just tasted burnt? It was too bitter and just tasted off? Maybe every time you make it, it tasted different. Let's make sure that you've got the right temperature for your tea. </p> 
    <p>A lot of teas like to brew in different water temperatures and at different lengths of time. The leaves and ingredients are all different, and the resulting tea will come out different depending on how you brew them. 
     </p> 
    <p><b>Here's what I do:</b> I usually brew my <b>black teas</b> in the hottest water I have available, which is aroud 200 degrees, as if it was just boiled and remove the tea from the water after 2-3 minutes, depending on wheter it's full leaf tea (2 minutes) or if it's a bag of tea that's been chopped to brew just a cup (3 minutes).</p> 
    <p>If it's a <b>mixed or herbal tea/tisane</b> (with ingredients that I really don't remember), I'll let the water cool for a minute, then add the tea for a nice soak (3 minutes)</p> 
    <p>For <b>green  teas</b>, I bring out the boiled water, and let it sit for at least a minute and a half and then brew the tea. I know that it has a short brewing time, so I usually don't even take my eyes off the cup, and I don't walk away. I really dislike forgetting and oversteeping green tea, because I just can't enjoy it and feel like I've wasted it.</p>     
	<p><b>White teas</b> are really delicate, so I brew these with boiled water that I may have forgotten about for a few minutes. I'm serious, if I've accidentally let my water cool more than I expected, I bring out the white tea for a quick light brew.</p> 
    <p>I recommend checking out the Art of Tea's <a class="post" href="http://www.artoftea.com/what-is-tea/recommended-steep-times/">Recommended Steep Times</a> as a good resource for steeping times and temperatures for a variety of teas.
    <p><b>That's all well and good, but don't stop there! </b> Your personal taste is king when it comes to how to make that perfect cup of tea. Take these tips and experiment with the teas you've got. Take the same tea and play with different brewing times. If it's a little strong, why not tweak the temperature? You may find your favorite blend taking on a different flavor just by changing some of these factors up, so don't be afraid to get that cup out and experiment.</p>
